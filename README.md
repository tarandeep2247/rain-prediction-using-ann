🌧️ Rain Prediction using Artificial Neural Network

This project was completed as part of my Master's in Computer Science at Coventry University, UK (2023-24) for the module Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

The goal of the project is to predict the likelihood of rain in Australia using an Artificial Neural Network. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, model design, training, and evaluation using a publicly available weather dataset.


🛠️ Tech Stack

    Python
